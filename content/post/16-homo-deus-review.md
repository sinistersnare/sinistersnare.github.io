Hello, I just finished _Homo Deus_ by Yuval Noah Harari, author of the acclaimed 'Sapiens'.
This is my review from the perspective of a Utopian, and fairly stream-of-consciousness style.

First, I think the book is first and foremost capitalist apologia. Every sentence should be critically analyzed and discounted. It has some good historical takes on the fall of state socialism. It also has interesting views on how humans evolve socially. It too easily assumes that because we are living in liberal capitalism now, liberal capitalism must be the only possible way to live. It also presupposes that economic and political value are literally the only reasons for humans to live, which is fairly dystopian.

Again, it does not have a good vision of the future. This is really important. He does not portray a good enough future. Think about it as you read, if you choose to read it. His future sounds cruelly neutral at best, and that scares me.

His central thesis relies on the understanding that each human provides value. And then therefore humans providing more value deserve more. That's fucking bullshit. I don't care how much other humans are worth I just want us all to be happy.

## Stories

His history is good and entertaining. I say that, but maybe I am just amazed by things I barely know. I found his computing history weak, personally. That makes me question his knowledge of fields that I know less of. There is some name for this phenomenon I think, but I do not remember it. Like, how much of this is actually bullshit, but I buy it because I'm not an expert.

I also think he discounts the advances of Computing Science as a field of metaphysics. All of his metaphors are based on computing terminology, from computability to completeness. In fact, he asks at the end of the book if there are things that can not be computed, and that has been known for a hundred years by computing scientists. His lack of understanding on this makes me question how accurate his takes on history are, no matter how entertaining.

His scientific takes are dystopian, unhelpful, and just kinda dumb. When he steps into the realm of science, I find his rhetoric extremely weak. Maybe this is too cynical, but he mentions a lot of contemporary tech startups. It just feels like he has a belief that Theranos was basically perfect, and it wasn't all just some lie to get private equity more money.

## Economics

His take on the future is based on "evolutionary humanism". He does not seriously discuss other possible futures. Only this one, and in detail.

He says that once human economic value is gone the literal only other thing to pursue is information. Not just fucking happiness. That couldn't possibly be worth discussing. Where's the economic and political value in happiness? His response maybe that happiness can be simply reduced to hormones and data. But my response is: So? Who cares? Well actually, he does deem happiness a humanist pursuit (and therefore passé). So I guess that makes it dealt with in his mind. But that seems pretty dumb. I mean to say, I don't think he gives credence at all to pleasure hedonism for example. He treats it as a humanist dogma and does not entertain it as something all of life should strive to.

It's like he read "Gödel Escher Bach" poorly, and then said: "oh if art and math are the same, art is just as valueless as sitting in a room thinking of math and not PRODUCING." What a weird take for so many reasons. A quote: "Musicologists, economists and sell biologists can finally understand each other." WHAT?? They've understood each other for thousands of years my dude. We are humans.

I mean, it is interesting reading these dystopian luke-warm takes, because it is just interesting how sad this guy is. If this is his take on the future, he really needs to touch some grass. It's like he needs to justify his existential nihilism by saying "hey it doesn't matter I'm sad, at least it's a useful data point," and then he carries on his day being sad without processing it.

## Politics

His understanding of 'communism' ends at state socialism. He pays no mind to what the marxists/etc. truly want, which is common goods, not nationalized goods. He claims it relies on centralized processing versus capitalism and distributed strategy. Completely misunderstanding that Marxism is about perfect distribution, and truly utilizing economies of scale.

I could take endless quotes to show his shallow hits on communism, as completely unfair characterizations. He describes state socialism so unfairly, but just as well uses contemporary business ethics as goal posts. The main problem, being that these businesses suffer from the same problems as Eastern European state socialism did. So his take just does not make sense to me. I'm not sure how to process it.

On the other hand he has complete faith in free market capitalism. He offers no critiques to the current system in any way at all. In fact, he offers arguments in favor of lowering taxes and further lowering regulations, without any discussion on the extremely unethical practices of his would-hope-to-be business-daddies Google and Facebook.

He also seems to have an unflappable belief that the current liberal capitalist system values everyone equally, at least insofar as they can be canon fodder in some pointless war for "economic value" or some bullshit. However this discounts the insane amount of oppression that our system requires, and he agrees is taken for granted in the system, as inegalitarian. We also treat our homeless population worse than ever before, we give them no dignity. I don't understand how he believe the system works the way he says.

## The Conclusion

We as humans are unable to grasp the scale of today's world. The numbers are simply too big. People don't understand that we do live in a post-scarcity world. It's time to start thinking as big as we have data for, and I can agree with Harari on that. But the differences in what our futures look like are almost total. We must use these algorithms to help _us_ understand the world, it does not matter if the algorithms understand us.

He also brings up something that needs to be discussed, and it is how we should deal with direct democracy in Utopia. He brings up that individually atomized humans are not actually a good unit of voting. However he does not offer any interesting alternatives, other than handwavy oh computers will just do it. No discussion of "election algorithms" to use his terminology, even though he never actually uses his terminology interestingly.

In the final chapter, Harari makes an argument for a new religion "dataism". He then makes an impassioned argument culminating mostly in the statement that Beethoven is more valuable than a folk song for some god-forsaken reason. What he complete discounts in this entire chapter (if not book!) is _metadata_. That is, data about data. Metadata enriches data and I think the author is blind to this. Just an observation of how I think that this dumb techno-religion is just poorly thought out ragebait. There is not sufficient logic to this hyperlogical tech-cult-religion, to put it meanly.

He makes a point to call out young people, saying that they will naturally fall into this. He claims that "people just want to be part of the data flow, even if that means giving up their privacy." This take just seems insane to me. The only reason that people do this is because there is literally no other way to get a job, talk to your friends, and connect with your family now. Harari mistakes subjugation for enthusiastic consent. I believe we are better than his vision of the future. Fight it.

The worst part of this book is that he never answers the question: what are humans going to do in the future? He claims that information will be given rights at the expense of human rights. He never challenges this or asks if it's right. The example he gives is provocative, and I do agree with it. However his phrasing that the freedom of information must come at the expense of freedom of expression I think does not hold water. His example, someone losing their ability to privately profit off of 'their' product, does not exemplify a loss of free expression, at least.

It is not until the FINAL TWO PAGES until Harari admits that this future that he paints is bleak (to use harsher words than he does). But given the prior THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE pages of tacit complicity, I can't claim this book to be positive in any way.

Personally I find his future backwards. It is not that we will fully succumb to the flow of information, it is that we will reject it as unnecessary.

# My Conclusion

I love thinking about the future, and how we could improve our world. I would much rather recommend ‘Everyday Utopia’ by Kristen R. Ghodsee. This book thinks about what went wrong in many utopian experiments (usually the state tearing them down), and what we can learn about making a better future from them.

Overall, don’t read Homo Deus. Read better books. But, if you have it in front of you, read it and continue thinking about the future! I also just want to say that a future utopia must not be agrarian, we must utilize economies of scale and community-scale effort. Have a good day!

If you have made it this far, hear my plea. Change the world. We have done enough protesting. We know the problems. Make a change, a real change. Build a Utopia.

Thanks! Let me know if you liked the review!
