# Workout #

This is a description of a workout

originally derived from https://greatist.com/move/beginner-barbell-workout

This article is mostly plagarized from that, so this article shouldnt be published.
At least, until I change this enough that its my own original work.

Thanks Greatist.com!

## Warmup ##

### Foam Rolling - 2 Minutes ###

30 seconds each:

* glutes
* quads
* upper back
* lats (sides of your upper back)

### Mobility - 8 Minutes ###

* Deep squat lat stretch

Sit in a deep squat with arms stretched in front of you, holding on to something like a bar, rail, or TRX that you can lightly pull back on. Hold for 5 deep breaths.

* Dead bug

Lie on your back with arms and thighs pointed up in the air, keeping your knees bent. Without bending elbows, bring right arm to the floor above your head and left leg down and out straight.

Return to starting position and repeat with opposite limbs. Do 5 reps per side.

* Kneeling glute mobilization

Start on all fours. Put the ankle of one foot into the inner knee of the other leg and sit all the way back, keeping your arms straight. This will stretch your glutes and should feel a little like a Pigeon Pose in yoga. Do 8 reps per side.

* Forearm wall slide

Face a wall. Place your forearms on the wall and point your hands upward, with your arms in the shape of a W. Slide your arms up the wall until theyâ€™re straight, bring them down, and pull them off the wall with your shoulders. Do 8 reps.

* Walking Spiderman with overhead reach

Lunge forward and bring both hands to the floor in front of you, inside your front leg. Keeping your hands where they are, straighten both legs for a nice stretch.

Bend your knees back to the lunge and twist your torso so one hand is high in the air and the other is still by your front foot, forming a letter T. Return to standing. Do 5 reps per side.
