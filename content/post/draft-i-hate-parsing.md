Parsing is dumb. Every compilers/PL class teaches it, but it just takes up time, and isnt that interesting.

The best part of compilation is _after_ you have your AST.

I suggest that every PL class just use Lisp! Only the most basic of parsing needed, and you can focus on the cool/interesting parts of PL: transformations, and semantics.

After you hook people into how cool the field is, then you show them the boring side of error-handling parsing and stuff like that.
