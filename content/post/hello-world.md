Hey! Intro Post!

I have got some great ideas for blog posts/series. Here is a couple:


1. The Robson Tree Traversal Algorithm.
2. Functional Language Compilers (Series)
3. Tesselation in Computer Graphics


Numbers 1 and 2 are very interesting to me, and I have work on both of them on my Github,
but I would love to make a post explaining the CS behind it.

Tesselation just seems really cool and I would love to talk about that.
