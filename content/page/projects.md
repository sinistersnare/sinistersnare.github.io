Hello, this is a list of some open source projects that I have worked on.

# [The Robson Traversal](https://github.com/sinistersnare/Robson) #

This _tree traversal algorithm_ is quite interesting. It is capable of pre-, in-, and post-order traversals, all while maintaining `O(1)` space consumption!

I have a blog post in the works detailing this algorithm. Until then, check out my repository for it!

# [SinScheme](https://github.com/sinistersnare/SinScheme) #

A probably not-standard-compliant Scheme implementation, written in Racket with a C++ runtime. It compiles to LLVM, and uses the Boehm GC for... GC.

Probably should not be used by your company, but I would love to keep working on it, and add cool features! I also hope to write about its compilation model, and the theory under it, in this blog. Let me know if you want to read such a blog post!

# [Royale With Cheese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvq58xaoRl8) #

A game I wrote in Unity for a class. It uses runtime nav-meshes, which were unavailable in Unity when I wrote this. It was quite a bit of fun to get it working!

Currently this is not open sourced, but I would like to open-source it soon. If you would like to see its code, let me know!
