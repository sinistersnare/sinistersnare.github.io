Hi! I am *D*avis *R*oss *S*ilverman (hence the URL).
I also go by my alter-ego: The Sinistersnare.

I love technology, I love to teach it, and I love to talk it.

I have my B.S. in C.S. from University of Maryland, College Park. I'm currently pursuing my PhD
at Syracuse University.

## Software ##

My interests mostly revolve around non-web stuff. Compilers, video games, and data structures are my interests in software.
I would like to write blog posts on those topics, so here I am!

I like to work in Python, Java, Rust, and functional languages.

## About This Site ##

This site is made with Hugo and the Minimo Theme.
Hugo proved to be the easiest static-site-generator to setup and use on Windows, would recommend.
