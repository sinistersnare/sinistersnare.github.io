Some ideas for future projects I want to do:

- A data network architecture that powers social media
	- Social Media should not own its data
- Email as a new social media product
	- involves a new email content type, ship apps via email.
- A fry cart
	- selling french fries out of a cart!
- Industrial production technologies also interest me.
