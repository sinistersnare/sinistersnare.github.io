Hi! I am Davis Ross Silverman (hence the URL)

I love technology, I love to teach it, and I love to talk it.

I am currently a Bachelor student at the University of Maryland, College Park.
I will be graduating in May 2018.


## Software ##

I work mostly on non-web stuff. Compilers, video games, and data structures are my interests in software.
I would like to write blog posts on those topics, so here I am!

I like to work in Python, Java, Rust, and other functional languages (including Lisps!)


## Gaming ##

I play a lot of Counter-Strike, and various games on my PC. Recommend me games, I will recommend some to you!

## About This Site ##

I made this site with Hugo and the Blackburn Theme (as the sidebar will tell you).
Hugo proved to be the easiest static-site-generator to setup and use on Windows, would recommend.
