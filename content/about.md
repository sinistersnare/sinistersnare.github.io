Hi! I am Davis Ross Silverman (hence the URL).
I also go by my alter-ego: The Sinistersnare.

I love technology, I love to teach it, and I love to talk it.

Currently pursuing a bachelor degree in computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park,
my graduation date is May 2018.


## Software ##

My interests mostly revolve around non-web stuff. Compilers, video games, and data structures are my interests in software.
I would like to write blog posts on those topics, so here I am!

I like to work in Python, Java, Rust, and other functional languages (including Lisps!)

## About This Site ##

This site is made with Hugo and the Blackburn Theme (as the sidebar will tell you).
Hugo proved to be the easiest static-site-generator to setup and use on Windows, would recommend.
