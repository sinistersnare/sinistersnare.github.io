Hi! I am <strong>D</strong>avis <strong>R</strong>oss <strong>S</strong>ilverman (hence the URL).
I also go by my alter-ego: The Sinistersnare.

I love technology, I love to teach it, and I love to talk it.

I have my B.S. in C.S. from University of Maryland, College Park. I'm currently pursuing my PhD
at Syracuse University.

## Software ##

My interests mostly revolve around non-web stuff. Compilers, video games, and data structures are my interests in software.
I would like to write blog posts on those topics, so here I am!

I like to work in Python, Java, Rust, and functional languages.

## Contact ##

My email is my username @ gmail.

## About This Site ##

Zola was easy to set up and use on Windows, which was nice!
