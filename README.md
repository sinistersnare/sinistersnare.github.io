Hey, this is my Blog's repository.
The source code is in the `source` branch,
and the generated HTML is in the `master` branch.

Enjoy!


## TODO: ##

* Make everything Bigger. I have this site at 140% for chrissake!
* Fix bug where RSS sidebar link goes missing on about and contact pages. Currently it is disabled.
* Use built-in highlight shortcode instead of what blackburn has?


## Adding New Fonts ##

1. Import config on static/icons/config.json onto http://fontello.com
2. Use https://icomoon.io to all files including `.eot` `.svg` `.ttf` `.woff` and `.woff2`
3. Download into static/icons (Keep the new config.json from Fontello)


## LICENSE ##

All stuff here is MIT licensed, as is all my code. Enjoy <3
